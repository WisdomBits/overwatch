> ### üöÄ What‚Äôs New?
> Overwatch now supports Server-Side Rendering **SSR**  (v 1.0.7)
---

A minimal API with developer flexibility, TypeScript-first state-management solution, inspired by the simplicity of **Zustand**, It's a super lightweight yet expressive **state management library for React Js & Next Js**, built on the **singleton design pattern**. It offers support for **global and instance-specific middlewares**, **immutability**, **batched updates**, and **custom event communication** ‚Äî all designed to be used without extensive boilerplate.

Goal with OverWatch was to prioritize reusability, a positive developer experience, and clear component-level state and event tracking.

## üöÄ What Is OverWatch?

> OverWatch evolved from an internal utility that leveraged the singleton and pub-sub patterns. We've now refined it for React, incorporating hooks, strong typing, and automatic cleanup to make it accessible to everyone.

OverWatch is:

* Built with **React hooks and TypeScript** (offering 100% type safety for predictable development).
* **Lightweight** ‚Äî you won't find context providers, reducers, or dispatches here.
* Ideal for managing both **component-level and application-level shared state**, providing flexibility for various needs.
* **Inspired by Zustand**: builds upon the simplicity and performance-first design of Zustand but reimagines it with a focus on advanced middleware, event-driven architecture, immutable state enforcement, and without the need for central store boilerplate.


---
## Why This Exists: State management should be straightforward & Sensible

If you've ever felt that Redux was too comprehensive for your needs, or that libraries like Zustand didn't offer enough specific control, OverWatch aims to provide a balanced approach. It combines a **minimal API** with **flexibility** to enhance your developer experience.

---

## Architecture: How It Works

At its core, OverWatch uses a **pub-sub pattern** to manage state effectively:

* Every **state key** functions as a communication **channel**.
* Components can **subscribe** to updates on these channels, acting as listeners.
* You can **publish changes** to state, either globally or specifically.
* **Middleware pipelines** run before changes are published, allowing for custom logic.
* **Batching** ensures that multiple updates are grouped efficiently, optimizing performance.
* **Immutability** is maintained, helping your state remain consistent and easy to reason about.

---

## How to Use: Getting Started

### Installation
To get started with OverWatch-TS, simply install it using npm or yarn:

```ts
# Using npm
npm install overwatch-ts

# Using yarn
yarn add overwatch-ts
```

### Step 1: `createSharedState(key, initialValue)`

This function initializes a shared state value globally. While **optional**, it's helpful for establishing a default state before any component mounts.

> If `createSharedState` isn't used, `useSharedState` will automatically create the key the first time it's accessed, providing a flexible starting point.

```ts
// Setting an initial theme
createSharedState('theme', { mode: 'dark' });
```

### Step 2: `useSharedState(key)`

> Use this hook in any component to **read** and **update** your shared state. It's your primary interface for interacting with OverWatch.

```ts
import { useSharedState } from 'overwatch-ts'; 

const ThemeSwitcher = () => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useSharedState<{ mode: string }>('theme');

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme({ mode: theme.mode === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark' });
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={toggleTheme}>
      Switch to {theme.mode === 'dark' ? 'Light' : 'Dark'} Mode
    </button>
  );
};
```

### Step 3: `usePicker(key, selectorFn)`

> This hook allows you to extract only a specific part of a shared state object, which can help optimize component rendering by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

```ts
import { usePicker } from 'overwatch-ts'; 

const ThemeIndicator = () => {
  const mode = usePicker('theme', t => t.mode);

  return <div>{mode === 'dark' ? 'üåë' : '‚òÄÔ∏è'}</div>;
};
```
**Why and when to use?**

* It helps prevent unnecessary re-renders, improving application performance.
* It's particularly useful for larger state objects where you only need to react to changes in one specific field.

### Step 4: `applyMiddleware(key, middlewareFn)`

> Use this to attach one or more **global middlewares** to a shared state key. These middlewares will apply to all updates for that specific state key.

```ts
import { applyMiddleware, createSharedState } from 'overwatch-ts'; 

// A simple logger for all 'theme' state changes
const globalThemeLogger = (newValue, next) => {
  console.log('Global Theme Change:', newValue);
  next(newValue); // Remember to call 'next' to continue the update
};

createSharedState('theme', { mode: 'dark' });
applyMiddleware('theme', globalThemeLogger);
```
(*NOTE*: If both instance-specific and global middlewares are applied to the same state, instance-specific middlewares will run first.)

### Step 5: Instance-specific Middleware (Component Level)

> If you need middleware to apply only within a specific component, you can pass it directly when using `useSharedState`.

```ts
import { useSharedState } from 'overwatch-ts'; 

const MyComponentWithLocalLogging = () => {
  const localLogger = (val, next) => {
    console.log('This runs only in this specific component:', val);
    next(val);
  };

  const [theme, setTheme] = useSharedState('theme', {
    middleware: [localLogger],
  });

  // ...rest of your component
};
```

## Component Communication: Beyond State Management

### Step 6: `useBroadcast` and `useEvent`

> These hooks are designed for one-time communications, such as triggering a logout action, showing a modal, or sending a specific notification across your application. While distinct from state management, they integrate seamlessly for a comprehensive communication solution.

**Broadcast an event:**

```ts
import { useBroadcast } from 'overwatch-ts'; 

const LogoutButton = () => {
  const broadcast = useBroadcast();

  const handleLogout = () => {
    // Perform logout logic...
    broadcast('LOGOUT'); // Emit the 'LOGOUT' event
  };

  return <button onClick={handleLogout}>Logout</button>;
};
```

**Listen for an event:**

```ts
import { useEvent } from 'overwatch-ts'; 
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'; // Example for React Router

const AuthListener = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  useEvent('LOGOUT', () => {
    console.log('Logout event received. Redirecting...');
    navigate('/login');
  });

  return null; // This component primarily serves as a listener
};
```

### What is Component Communication?

In many applications, especially those with deep component trees or when React Context feels too rigid, there's a need for **cross-component communication** that's both decoupled and clear. OverWatch's event system addresses this by:

* Offering a **central event bus** built on the pub-sub model.
* Leveraging **custom React hooks** for subscribing to and publishing events.
* **Automatically unsubscribing** events when components unmount, preventing memory leaks.
* Tracking **which component** subscribed to which event for better debugging.
* Being fully written in **TypeScript** and easily tree-shakable for efficient bundling.

---

## Ideal Use Cases: Where OverWatch Excels

* Decoupled communication between unrelated components.
* Managing temporary global states (e.g., flash messages, user actions).
* Providing an alternative to prop drilling or over-reliance on React Context.

## ‚ú®Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Support

Overwatch supports SSR (Server Side Rendering) via a dedicated `ServerStore` interface, giving you full control over how shared state is created, serialized, and hydrated across the client-server boundary.

How to use (**‚ú®Easy!**)
* On the server, create a new store instance using createServerStore().
* Set and read state via that store during rendering.
* On the client, hydrate the store using Hyrated wrapper before your app renders.

> That's it 3 steps

---

### üß© The ServerStore Interface

Use `createServerStore()` to get a per-request store instance:

```ts
const serverStore = createServerStore();
```

Use `serverStore.getSnapshot()` to pass it to the client, and `serverStore.hydrate()` or `useHydratedStore` on the client to Hydrate client-side stores with no flickering.

---

### üß™ Example 1 ‚Äì SSR in React (Node Server)

```tsx
// Server: Express/Node
import { createServerStore } from 'overwatch-ts';

const serverStore = createServerStore();
serverStore.set('theme', 'dark'); // Inject initial state

const app = renderToString(
  <App store={serverStore} />
);

// Send snapshot to client
const initialState = serverStore.getSnapshot();
res.send(`
  <script>window.__OVERWATCH_SNAPSHOT__ = ${JSON.stringify(initialState)}</script>
`);
```

```tsx
// Client: Hydrate snapshot
import { useHydratedStore } from 'overwatch-ts';

if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.__OVERWATCH_SNAPSHOT__) {
  useHydratedStore(window.__OVERWATCH_SNAPSHOT__);
}
```

---

### ‚ö° Example 2 ‚Äì With Next.js (App Router)

```tsx  file=overwatchStore.js
'use client'

import { createServerStore } from 'overwatch-ts';

export const serverStore = createServerStore();
```

```tsx file=app/page.tsx
import { Hydrated } from 'overwatch-ts';
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  // Set some state server-side

  serverStore.set('theme', { mode: 'dark' });

  return {
    props: {
      initialSnapshot: serverStore.getSnapshot(),
    },
  };
}

export default function Home({ initialSnapshot }) {
  return (
    // Wrapper that renders children only after client is fully hydrated
     <Hydrated snapshot={initialSnapshot}>
      <ToogleTheme /> // client *components
    </Hydrated>
  );
}
```
On the client
```tsx file=ToogleTheme.js
"use client"
export const ToogleTheme = () => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useSharedState('theme');
  return (<>
    <h1>{theme.mode}</h1>
  </>)
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

* Use `createServerStore()` to create scoped state per request.
* Populate initial state using `createSharedState(...)`.
* Use `store.getSnapshot()` and pass it to the client.
* Hydrate on the client using `Hydrated` wrapper before using hooks.
* All hooks internally default to the global store unless a `store` is passed manually. (Not Recommended, only for advance use cases)
